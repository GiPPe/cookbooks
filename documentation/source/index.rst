Web Operations Manual
=====================

.. epigraph::

   We say that Web Operations is an art, not a science, for a reason. There are
   no standards, certifications, or formal schooling (at least not yet). What
   we do takes a long time to learn and longer to master, and everyone at every
   skill level must find his or her own style. There's no "right way," only
   what works (for now) and a commitment to doing it even better next time.

   The Web is changing the way we live and touches every person alive. As more
   and more people depend on the Web, they depend on us.  Web Operations is
   work that matters.
