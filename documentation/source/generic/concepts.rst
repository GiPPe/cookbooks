Basic Concepts
==============

The fundamental concept of operations is **DevOps**. DevOps is a set of
processes, methods and systems for communication, collaboration and integration
between departments for *Development (Applications/Software Engineering)* and
*Technology Operations*. Its purpose is to facilitate meeting business goals by
producing good quality software products and services in a timely fashion. [#rajiv]_

Another fundamental concept is directly derived from the DevOps culture:
**Infrastructure as Code**. The goal is simple:

  Enable the reconstruction of the business from nothing but a source code
  repository, an application data backup, and bare metal resources

In practice this means rethinking the way we design, build and manage our
systems. We need to break infrastructure down into modular services (Service
Oriented Architecture, SOA), and tie them together in an automatable way.
