Part 1 - Generic Documentation
==============================

This part describes the technologies (and their fundamental usage) used by
computer systems implemented according to this manual and the site-specific
specifications and policies defined in :doc:`../local/index`.

This part requires a basic understandig of Linux/Unix system administration
including package management, user management, using a text editor such as vi
and some basic network and service management skills.

Specifically, the foundation for all systems implemented according to this
manual is `Gentoo Linux`_ - a very powerful and for beginners sometimes complex
Linux distribution. To get started you should have at least read the `Working
with Gentoo`_ and `Working with Portage`_ sections of the `Gentoo Handbook`_.

Additionally, every software that can be deployed using the techniques
described in this manual may require solid knowledge which cannot be covered in
great detail. References to further documentation may be provided where
appropriate, but the authors expect the user to gain the necessary knowledge
independently if required.
