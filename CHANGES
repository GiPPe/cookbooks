    This iteration introduces basic debian support. Not all cookbooks have
    been ported but at least role[base] is now convergable on debian
    systems.

    The c500k role has been extended with some additional optimizations:

     * net.core.netdev_max_backlog
     * net.ipv4.tcp_rmem and net.ipv4.tcp_wmem
     * net.core.rmem_max and net.core.wmem_max
     * net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets
     * net.ipv4.tcp_no_metrics_save
     * net.ipv4.tcp_sack
     * net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps
     * fs.file-max

    The maximum number of file descriptors now defaults to 524288 (2^19) for
    normal systems and 2097152 (2^21) for c500k systems. The number of open
    file descriptors a process is allowed to use now defaults to 262144
    (2^18) for normal systems and 1048576 (2^20) for c500k systems.

    It should also be noted that most services do not set a high listen
    backlog by default (e.g. nginx). So even having high resource limits is
    no guarantee for high connection throuput if the application does not
    allow it.

    A lot of effort has been put into streamlined support for systemd and
    the journal:

     * All hostmaster users will now have read-only access to the
       journal through the systemd-journal group.
     * The default limit for NOFILE has been changed system-wide and for all
       systemd user-sessions to support c500k setups more easily.
     * All chef-server components now log into the journal.
     * shorewall.service has been fixed to support LXC systems.
     * Support for systems without a running systemd instance has been
       improved.

    The small stuff:

     * Splunk now uses single sign-on
     * Hostmaster accounts are now deployed in the very beginning so that
       login is still possible even if chef fails to bootstrap the machine
       eventually.
     * Ruby has been updated to ruby-1.9.3-p429
