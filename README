This is a blank repository you can use as a starting point for your
local chef configuration.

There have been massive modifications to the rake tasks and therefore chefs
upstream Rakefile is not used anymore.

There are 3 groups of rake tasks:

  - load: load entities like cookbooks, roles, nodes and data bags into the
          chef server
  - rc: execute remote commands on nodes matching a solr query
  - ssl: manage an SSL Certificate Authority

For full details on the parts aside from information contained in the
README files, see the Chef wiki documentation at:
